COMP 3270 Intro to Algorithms Homework 1: Introduction to Python
install python (google it) and make sure you have python version 3.6+

Problem 1: Implement merge sort
'''
# your code here




'''
Problem 2: Implement quick sort 2 ways. 1 using a random element as the pivot. 2nd using the median of 3 random elements as the pivot
'''
#your code here



'''
Problem 3: Compare the runtime between merge sort, quick sort with random pivot, and quick sort with median of 3 random elements on lists ranging from 100k to 2m by increments of 100k 
use the time package to get the time, so use start = time.time() then after the algorithm runs end = time.time()
make a graph of this. I recommend the ggplot python port plotnine, but matplotlib would be fine as well
'''
#your code here
# inputs might look like A = [random.randint(0,1000000000) for i in range(100000)]
